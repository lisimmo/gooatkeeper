# Goat Keeper API

This API application is built with Ruby on Rails and allows users to manage animal records on a farm. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete goat, breeds and treatments records, as well as perform various queries and filtering.

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available in the Goat Keeper API:

- `GET /goats`: Retrieve a list of all goats.

### Query Parameters

The `GET /goats` endpoint supports the following query parameters:

- `breed=true`: Includes the breed of the goat in the response.
- `treatments=true`: Includes the treatment history of the goat in the response.

You can provide one or more query parameters to narrow down the search results.

## Authentication and Authorization

The User Apis uses token-based authentication for secure access. To perform authenticated requests, include the `Authorization` header with a valid token.
For now, it is just to showcase jwt authentication

## Error Handling

The API handles errors using appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in JSON format. If an error occurs, the response will contain an `error` field with a descriptive message.
